								<h2>Medical language model application in initial breast cancer recurrence recognition using random forest algorithm</h2>
							</header><p><br>Purpose</br>
Breast cancer is one of the most common cancers among women in Taiwan. Despite high survival rates with early detection, some patients experience recurrence and metastasis even decades later, posing a significant long-term medical burden. Utilizing text mining techniques to establish a medical language model for interpreting massive amounts of recurrence follow-up examination reports and creating a semi-automated report interpretation system can significantly reduce medical manpower and healthcare costs. This study aims to establish a cancer registry language model for initial recurrence recognition using the cancer registry database and follow-up examination reports of breast cancer patients.
</p>

							<p><br>Materials and Methods</br>
A total of 478 breast cancer patients with 3152 periodic follow-up examination reports were enrolled under an approved protocol. All examination reports were used to establish a breast cancer recurrence-specific corpus, and a recurrence classification model based on the corpus was constructed using the random forest algorithm.</p>

							<p><br>Results</br>
The importance of 1949 extracted features in the recurrence classification model was computed and ranked. The Area Under the Precision-Recall Curve (AUPRC) from all features and the top-ranked 10 to 100 features were compared. The optimal AUPRC was achieved with 90 features, rather than with the maximum number of features.</p>

<p><br>Conclusion</br>
The optimal performance, indicated by the highest AUPRC, emphasizes the importance of feature selection. Future work should focus on refining the model, exploring additional text mining techniques, and validating the system in larger, diverse patient cohorts to enhance its robustness and generalizability.</p>
